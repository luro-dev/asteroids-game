# Asteroids Game (Python, Pygame)

A modular, object-oriented 2D Asteroids game implemented in Python using **Pygame**, launched from the command line. The game features dynamic asteroid spawning, projectile shooting, and asteroid splitting based on size.

## Features

- **Player controls**: Move and shoot projectiles in real time.  
- **Dynamic asteroid field**: Asteroids spawn continuously and split into smaller asteroids upon being hit.  
- **Collision detection**: Optimized system for detecting collisions between projectiles and asteroids.  
- **Modular design**: Classes for Player, Asteroid, Projectile, and Game Logic to maintain clean, maintainable code.  
- **CLI launch**: Start the game from the command line while running in a Pygame window.  
- **Environment management**: Uses `venv` for virtual environment and `uv` for Python dependency management.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+  
- Pygame  
- venv / uv (optional, recommended for environment management)

## Installation
